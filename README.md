# Example usage of the Cloudflare API to work with CloudFlare Tunnels.

This is a old example based on the api at the moment of April 2023. At the moment there were issues with UnvalidatedIngressRule.OriginRequest not being up to data between the golang api and the rest API. Those issues should be fixed now but have not tried them out.
But for my usecase of changing the hostname it was needed.
